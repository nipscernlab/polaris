# POLARIS  

**POLARIS** is a modern, high-performance **cross-platform graphical interface** designed for the **SAPHO (Scalable Architecture Processor for Hardware Optimization)** ecosystem.

Developed using **Tauri** and **Rust**, POLARIS runs on **Linux and Windows**, combining native performance with a compact and reliable architecture.

The interface provides tight integration with the SAPHO toolchain, enabling users to:

- Write and edit CMM and SAPHO-related code using **Monaco Editor**
- Compile processor designs through SAPHO compilers
- Visualize processor structures via the **PRISM RTL Viewer**
- Run and analyze simulations using **YAWT (Wave Tracer)**
- Customize workflows and integrations through a flexible **API-driven system**

POLARIS was designed as a **lightweight and modular successor to AURORA**, serving as the primary visual and interactive environment for SAPHO-based hardware and processor development
